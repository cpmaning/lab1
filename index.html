        Hi, my name is Christian Maning!<br>
        You can call me by my surname. 
        I'am 19 years old. I currently live with my mother at Evangelista in Makati.
        
        <p>Introduction</p>
        As for my story, I really don't have  something unusual or unique experiences currently.All seems to be<br>
        pretty normal. I manage most of time in leisure like playing games and surfing the net.<br>
        Watching new educational stuff. I also spend time with my parents and friends as equally as<br>
        much as possible, depends on the time I have. People often see me as a quiet type of person<br>
        but once they get to know me I get to be more open and hyperactive. I usually have different attitudes<br>
        depends on who I'm with. I'm more respectful when I'm with the company of adults, strangers or authorities.<br>
        I'm usually lazy but can be hardworking when needed.<br>
        
        <p>Expectations to USERDES Subject</p>
        My expectations for this class are that it's gonna be challenging for me but I'll do my best to still get<br> 
        a high grade. Learning new things to help me design an application or a website.<br>
